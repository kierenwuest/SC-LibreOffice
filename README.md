# StoreConnect Salesforce Data Interface for LibreOffice Calc (SC-LibreOffice)

The StoreConnect Salesforce Data Interface for LibreOffice Calc (SC-LibreOffice) is a purpose-built application designed to streamline the management of Salesforce data for organisations leveraging StoreConnect. By integrating Salesforce data operations into the familiar and user-friendly LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet interface, SC-LibreOffice transforms data management into an intuitive, efficient, and highly productive process.

This tool brings the core functionality of Salesforce data loaders directly into Calc, allowing users to manage entire datasets across multiple spreadsheet tabs. While its primary functionality mirrors Salesforce data loaders, SC-LibreOffice is uniquely tailored for the StoreConnect object model, making it an indispensable tool for managing content, configurations, and data within StoreConnect-powered Salesforce orgs.

SC-LibreOffice bridges the gap between the powerful data management capabilities of Salesforce and the familiar interface of a spreadsheet application. Tailored for the StoreConnect object model, this tool offers a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for managing Salesforce data, transforming data operations into a seamless experience for administrators, partners, and business users alike.
